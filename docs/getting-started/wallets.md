    === "Receive"

        * Copy your address (`mugle1...`) and provide it to the other party.

        ![mugle++ receive step1](images/mugleplusplus-receive.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        That's it. If both your wallets can communicate via Tor, the transaction is then completed automatically.

        *But if there's no Tor communication, next steps are:*

        * The sender will provide you a Slatepack message. Paste it into the Slatepack box and click Receive.

        ![mugle++ receive step2](images/mugleplusplus-receive2.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * Copy the Slatepack message your wallet generates.

        ![mugle++ slatepack](images/mugleplusplus-slatepack.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * Provide it to the sender.

        Done! The sender will finalize the transaction and post it to the network.

    === "Send"

        * Click send.

        ![mugle++ receive step3](images/mugleplusplus-send.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * Choose the amount of mugles.

        ![mugle++ receive step4](images/mugleplusplus-send2.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * Enter the receiver's address and send.

        ![mugle++ receive step4](images/mugleplusplus-send3.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        That's it. If both your wallets can communicate via Tor, the transaction is then completed automatically.

        *But if there's no Tor communication, next steps are:*

        * Copy the Slatepack message your wallet generates and provide it to the receiver (however you want).

        ![mugle++ receive step4](images/mugleplusplus-slatepack.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        * You should get a Slatepack message back from the receiver. Paste it into the Slatepack box and click Finalize.

        ![mugle++ receive step4](images/mugleplusplus-send4.png){ width=400 loading="lazy" }

        Done! Your wallet will now finalize the transaction and post it to the network.
