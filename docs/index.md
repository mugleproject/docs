Simple, privacy-focused, scalable Mimblewimble chain implementation.

Mugle aims to serve as digital cash. To provide electronic transactions for all, without censorship or restrictions.

## Principles

### Open

Mugle is developed openly, by individual contributors all over the world. There's no company or foundation behind it, and no ICO, founder reward, pre-mine or dev-tax. The coin distribution is designed to be as fair (but not gratis) as is known to be possible.

### Private

Privacy by default. Transactions have no amount, no addresses and can be trivially aggregated. This enables complete fungibility without precluding the ability to selectively disclose information as needed.

### Scalable

Scales mostly with the number of users and minimally with the number of transactions. Past transactional data can be pruned, making mugle drastically lightweight compared to other blockchains.

### Simple

Minimal implementation that strives to remain as clear and simple as possible, making it easy to audit and maintain over time.

### Proven

Mimblewimble relies on Elliptic Curve cryptography which has been tried and tested for decades. 
A formal study of its security was [published](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1039) in one of the [flagship conferences of the the International Association for Cryptologic Research](https://www.iacr.org/meetings/eurocrypt/).
